  # Japan-PaBUYan
An On-Demand E-commerce Platform specifically designed to streamline the assisted buying process of Japanese products for customers in the Philippines.

# Project Overview
This project was developed for a client specializing in personal shopping and package forwarding from Japan to the Philippines. Unlike a traditional online store, this platform acts as a high-efficiency Wishlist and Sourcing Tool.

 How it works:
Exploration
Users create their wish list and browse through recommended items.

Simplified Identification
To reduce friction, users identify themselves with basic contact details (Name/Phone) without the need for complex password-managed accounts.

Wishlist Creation
Customers add the specific products they want by providing:

Reference Links
Direct URLs from Japanese marketplaces (Amazon JP, Rakuten, Mercari, etc.).

Descriptions
Details such as size, color, or specific instructions.

Order Processing
Once the wishlist is submitted, the data is stored in the backend (Strapi). The final payment, international shipping from Japan, and local delivery in the Philippines are handled privately between the business owner and the customer.

# Development Status (Personal Note)
Disclaimer: This project is being developed during my spare time. Due to my current full-time work schedule, progress is made in focused, incremental daily blocks.

Current Technical Decisions:

Static Assets: Currently serving images from the frontend to ensure smooth deployment on free tiers while the final hosting plan is being finalized.

UX Strategy: Priority is given to mobile responsiveness, as the target audience in the Philippines primarily accesses the service via smartphone.
